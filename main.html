                            <p class="card-text"> The first movie on my list is King Richard. This is just about the most touching movie I've ever watched. The movie is an epic representation of one of Serena and Venus Williams, Serena being one of the greatest athletes ever. Every hero has a story right? I remember how I cried at some point during the movie, and I had to walk out of the cinema hall. This movie shows the priceless importance of having the full backing of your family in your pursuit in life. Serena and Venus Williams would never have made it to the history books without the stern and unconditional support of their family</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">The Pochito! I will never forget when the thriller for this movie came out and I just could not wait for the official release date. Being a cinema staff, I was part of the first set of people to watch the advanced screening of this movie as well. I remember how I shed some crocodile tears that did not leave my eyeballs when Gen. Nanisca was reunited with her lost daughter, Nawi the brave and fearless young female soldier. The woman king is a timeless movie, with solid acting by all the actors. My anticipation for the movie was met with a solid delivery. Viola Davis was quite flawless in this movie</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">Every young guy in this part of the world knows about the shoes called Air Jordans, but I bet many do not know the story behind this iconic brand. I had no idea what went down before this brand became a global brand. Like I said in my review of King Richard, family support is quite important to the success of any child in life. This movie perfectly backs up this theory of mine. Viola Davis delivers another top rated mother-child family bond by guiding her son to the lifetime Air Jordan brand. I learnt a lot from this movie personally. One has to respect the input of parents in the success stories of a number of these sports stars around the world.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">Another priceless movie is Rise! This movie is the story behind the success of the popular NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo. I remember when he turned pro and his name was everywhere on the news, but I did not pay much attention to his story. But when I saw the movie last year, I literally broke down into tears. The price that parents pay to see to the success of their children is invaluable. Without the sacrifices of the parents and siblings, there would have been no Giannis</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">"3 Idiots" is a heartwarming and inspiring Bollywood film that challenges the conventional education system. With exceptional performances and a perfect blend of humor and emotion, it explores friendship, pursuing dreams, and questioning societal pressures. A must-watch gem of Indian cinema that leaves a lasting impact.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">The next one on my list tells the story of the best driver to have ever graced the game, and this is none other than Ayrton Senna of blessed memory. The movie tells a perfect story of the success of the three-time world champion, and how his career came to an untimely end. His story is like every other successful athlete out there, he had a very strong family support as well. Can you imagine that he started racing at age 13? In my country, you have no guts to tell your parents that you want to go into professional sport at age 13 and then, expect them to support you with all they have. Well, this movie is the story of the legendary Ayrton Senna, the best of the best. Rest on legend</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">One of the most epic battles in the formula one world happens to have happened in the era of James Hunt and Nikki Lauda. This movie tells the true life story of two extremely gifted and talented drivers. One was a raw talent at the peak of his career and had no discipline at all. He did what he wanted and paid no attention to his health. Nikki Lauda on the other hand was very disciplined and principled with his career. No wonder Nikki lasted longer in the game and went on to forge a lasting name in the industry, and the aviation business as well. Please do not blink at any point while watching this movie, you will miss a great deal of action if you do</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">Maverick! Maverick!! Maverick!!! Talk about a timeless act from the man who never grows old, Tom Cruise. I watched the 2022 edition of this movie last year before watching the 1986 edition of the movie. Please try to watch the 1986 edition if you want to enjoy it, and have a deep understanding of the entire franchise. This tells the story of a legendary fighter pilot, who lost his wingman at the academy when he was younger. This was devastating for him, and he literally quit the academy initially but he came back to graduate with his set. Years later, he was an instructor at the academy and he had to teach the set on the ground, which included the son of his former wingman that died in training. It was an emotional scene for him because he was being overprotective of Rooster, his friend's son. The scenario changed eventually, and both men got along really fine. Enough of the writing! You need to get down to business and see for yourself</p>

What happens when you are the younger brother of a legendary adventurer/explorer? You are definitely going to end up being one yourself. This is the role that Tom Holland portrayed in this movie, alongside his fellow lead actor Mark  Wahlberg. This is a solid movie for all fans of the action genre  </p>

Caught in a high-speed chase, the two siblings must figure out a way to outrun the law while keeping their hostages alive. My favorite part of this movie is the driving</p>
